License Information
###################

Horton is distributed under the conditions of the GPL License version 3. Amongst
other things, this has the following practical implications:

- You are free to use Horton for any purpose but the (re)distribution of Horton
  or any derived program must be done under the same license conditions.

- Once you share a modified version of Horton with someone, there is no legal
  way to stop your modified version from being distributed further. If you want
  to keep a new feature under the radar until it is published in a scientic
  journal, then only share it with people you absolutely trust.

- All contributors maintain copyrights on their contributions but by sharing
  their contribution, they agree to do so under the conditions of the GPL
  License version 3.

provided for your convenience:
