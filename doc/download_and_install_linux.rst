Download and Installation on Linux (Fedora and Ubuntu)
######################################################


Disclaimer
==========

Horton has been tested on Fedora and Ubuntu Linux. If you are running
any other operating system, some of the instructions below may not work.


Download the code
=================

Stable release (recommended)
----------------------------

The latest stable source code release of Horton can be downloaded here:

    https://github.com/theochem/horton/releases/download/2.0.0/horton-2.0.0.tar.gz

Choose a suitable directory, e.g. ``~/build``, download and unpack the archive

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p ~/build
    cd ~/build
    curl -O https://github.com/theochem/horton/releases/download/2.0.0/horton-2.0.0.tar.gz
    tar -xvzf horton-2.0.0.tar.gz
    cd horton-2.0.0


Latest development code (experts only)
--------------------------------------

In order to get the latest development version of the source code, and to upload
your own changes, you need to work with git. Git is a version control system
that makes life easy when a group of people are working on a common source code.
All information about git (including downloads and tutorials) can be found here:
http://git-scm.com/. The official git URL of Horton is:
``git://github.com/theochem/horton.git``. On most Linux distributions, git can be
installed with a package manager:

* **Ubuntu Linux**:

  .. code-block:: bash

     sudo apt-get install git

* **Fedora Linux**:

  .. code-block:: bash

     sudo yum install git

In order to `clone` the public Horton repository, run these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p ~/build
    cd ~/build
    git clone git://github.com/theochem/horton.git
    cd horton

The version history can be updated with the latest patches with the following
command:

.. code-block:: bash

    git pull

There is also a web interface to Horton's git repository:
https://github.com/theochem/horton


Dependencies for building, installing and testing Horton
========================================================

In order to compile and test Horton, you need to install relatively recent
versions of the following programs/libraries:

* Python >= 2.7, < 3.0: http://www.python.org/ (also install `development files`)
* Nosetests >= 1.1.2: http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest/
* GCC, G++ and GFortran >= 4.5: http://gcc.gnu.org/ (In principle the Intel compilers or
  any other of your favorite compilers should work. The GNU compilers are used for
  development and testing.)
* Atlas >= 3.10.1: http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/ (or any other BLAS implementation that you like more)
* Numpy >= 1.7.0: http://www.numpy.org/
* Scipy >= 0.10.0: http://www.scipy.org/
* Cython >= 0.17.1 : http://www.cython.org/
* h5py >= 2.2.1: http://www.h5py.org/
* Sympy >= 0.7.1: http://code.google.com/p/sympy/
* Matplotlib >= 1.0: http://matplotlib.org/
* LibXC >= 2.2.2: http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/wiki/index.php/Libxc
* LibInt2 >= 2.0.3: http://sourceforge.net/p/libint/home
* Curl: http://curl.haxx.se/


Installing dependencies with a package manager
----------------------------------------------

With popular Linux distributions, most of these dependencies can be installed
with a package manager:

* **Ubuntu Linux** (does not have a libint2 package, see section :ref:`linux_manual_dependency_install`):

  .. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python-dev gcc g++ gfortran python-numpy python-h5py \
                         python-scipy cython python-nose python-sympy \
                         python-matplotlib libxc-dev libatlas-base-dev curl

* **Fedora Linux**:

  .. code-block:: bash

    sudo yum install python-devel gcc gcc-c++ gcc-gfortran numpy h5py scipy \
                     Cython python-sphinx python-nose sympy python-matplotlib \
                     libint2-devel libxc-devel atlas-devel curl

.. _linux_manual_dependency_install:

Installing dependencies manually
--------------------------------

If the package manager of your Linux distribution does not have the desired
packages (or the right versions), you have to install them manually, e.g.
download and execute an installer, or download and unpack a binary package. On
HPC environments a compilation from scratch is recommended.

**BLAS**

In principle, any BLAS implementation may be used. In case of a custom build,
some environment variables must be set prior to building Horton, as discussed
in :ref:`linux_compile_install`.


**LibXC**

The directory ``depends`` of the Horton source tree contains a make file that
will download and build LibXC, which will work on most systems:

.. code-block:: bash

    (cd depends; make libxc)

This results in a libxc library suitable for static linking. If this fails,
consult your local Linux guru to build LibXC. For more info about LibXC, check
the website: http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/wiki/index.php/Libxc

**LibInt2**

The directory ``depends`` of the Horton source tree contains a make file that
will download and build LibInt2, which will work on most systems:

.. code-block:: bash

    (cd depends; make libint -j4)

The compilation of libint takes a few minutes and results in a library for
static linking. If this fails, consult your local Linux guru to build LibInt2.
For more info about LibInt2, check the website:
http://sourceforge.net/p/libint/home

**Python dependencies**

In some cases, PIP, the Python package manager, may be a good choice to install
the most recent versions of the Python packages in the list of dependencies.
Assuming that you have installed some compilers, the Python development files
and HDF5 development files, the following command installs the remaining
dependencies in your home directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --user numpy scipy cython h5py sphinx nose sympy


Reference atoms
===============

This step can be skipped when compiling a stable release because each stable
release already contains reference atoms.

Several parts of Horton make use of reference atomic computations. These files
are too large to be included in the git revision system. Therefore, they must be
downloaded separately when compiling a development version of Horton:

.. code-block:: bash

    (cd data/refatoms; make all)

.. _linux_compile_install:

Compilation and installation
============================

Build and install
-----------------

The regular build and install is done as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./setup.py install --user

The ``setup.py`` script makes a reasonable attempt at configuring the compiler and
linker settings for the LibXC, LibInt2 and BLAS libraries. However, this does
not work in all environments. In case of a failure, or if a configuration other
than the default is desired, read the following section.


Overriding default compiler/linker settings for LibXC, LibInt2 and BLAS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The manual configuration of the compiler and linker settings is described here:
:ref:`setup_cfg`. You should read this section if the default build and install
has failed or if you would like to specify which libraries to use.


Runtime Configuration
---------------------

You need to set the following variable in ``~/.bashrc`` to use Horton:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH=${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}

    # If you used special link options for LibXC, LibInt2 or BLAS, something along
    # the following lines may also be needed:
    # export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=some_dir/with/shared_objects/${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

If you run Horton on a headless node, i.e. without an X server, you need to
configure Matplotlib to use a backend that does not require a graphical user
interface. (See http://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#what-is-a-backend for
more details on the Matplotlib backends.) This can be done by adding the
following line to your ``matplotlibrc`` file:

.. code-block:: text

    backend: agg

This file is located in either ``${HOME}/.matplotlib`` or
``${HOME}/.config/matplotlib``.


Running the tests
=================

To test if Horton was installed properly and if it can be accessed from any directory,
you should change to a directory outside of the source tree and call nosetests
as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    (cd ~; nosetests -v horton)

Building the documentation
==========================

Dependencies
------------

If you are interested in generating the documentation from source, the following
packages are also needed:

* Sphinx >= 1.3.1: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/
* Doxygen >= 1.8.6: http://www.doxygen.org/
* Breathe >= 1.2.0: http://breathe.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
* Docutils >= 0.11: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/
* A latex distribution (Texlive)
* DVIpng >= 1.14: http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/dvipng/
* The Preview style for Latex (preview.sty)


Installing the dependencies with a package manager and PIP
----------------------------------------------------------

* **Ubuntu packages**:

  .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt-get install doxygen preview-latex-style python-docutils \
                           python-pip dvipng preview-latex-style

* **Fedora packages**:

  .. code-block:: bash

      sudo yum install doxygen tex-preview python-docutils python-pip dvipng \
                       tex-preview

Since Breathe (>=1.2.0) and Sphinx (>=1.3.1) may not be available through the
Linux repositories, it should be installed manually. For example, it is
available through PyPI.

**PIP packages**:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --user --upgrade sphinx breathe

If you don't want to rebuild the documentations with sphinx every time you make
a change, you can use the `sphinx-autobuild` tool available through PyPI.
Installation is pretty much like any other PyPI package:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --user sphinx-autobuild

You must also build LibXC statically in the ``depends`` directory, as explained
above, to generate the list of DFT functionals in the documentation.



Actual build
------------

The documentation is compiled and viewed as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    (cd doc; make html; firefox _build/html/index.html)

If you are using `sphinx-autobuild`  the command is as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    (cd doc; firefox http://localhost:8000; make livehtml)

This sets up a server at `localhost:800` and makes browser update whenever you make a change to the
source files, as any other process you can stop it with `Ctrl-C`
