Dumping/Loading a Hamiltonian to/from a file
############################################

Horton supports two formats for Hamiltonians: (i) an internal binary format based on HDF5 (extension ``.h5``) and Molpro's FCIDUMP text format (containing ``FCIDUMP`` somewhere in the file name). The internal format is more flexible and can store a Hamiltonian in various different ways. The FCIDUMP format is more restrictive but can be used to interoperate with different codes, e.g. Molpro. (Horton can also load integrals from a Gaussian log file but this is
absolutely not recommended for any serious calculation.)

For general information on how to load and dump data with Horton in different data file formats, refer to :ref:`ref_file_formats`.


.. _hamiltonian_io_internal:

Horton's Internal format
========================

Dumping
-------

One can store all the separate operators in the atomic-orbital (AO) basis, here using a Cholesky decomposition of the four-center integrals, as follows:

.. literalinclude :: ../data/examples/hamiltonian/dump_internal_ao.py
    :caption: data/examples/hamiltonian/dump_internal_ao.py
    :lines: 2-

Note that the attributes ``coordinates``, ``numbers`` and ``title``, which were loaded from the ``.xyz`` file, will also be dumped in the internal format, unless you explicitly remove them first with e.g. ``del mol.title``. The internal format will just store any attribute of an ``IOData`` instance, not just the ones that are documented, see :py:class:`horton.io.iodata.IOData`. So, you may assign other attributes as well, e.g. ``obasis`` or ``olp``, if that is convenient.

In the HDF5 file, all data is stored binary in full precision. The layout of the
HDF5 file in this example is as follows:

.. code-block:: text

    $ h5dump -n hamiltonian_ao.h5
    HDF5 "hamiltonian.h5" {
    FILE_CONTENTS {
     group      /
     dataset    /coordinates
     dataset    /core_energy
     group      /er
     dataset    /er/array
     group      /kin
     dataset    /kin/array
     group      /na
     dataset    /na/array
     dataset    /numbers
     dataset    /title
     }
    }

The attributes used for the FCIDUMP format, ``one_mo``, ``two_mo``, ``core_energy``, ``nelec`` and ``ms2`` can also be used for the internal format. The following example shows how this can be done with a ``IOData`` object created from scratch.

.. literalinclude::  ../data/examples/hamiltonian/dump_internal_ao_fcidump.py
    :caption: data/examples/hamiltonian/dump_internal_ao_fcidump.py
    :lines: 2-

which results in the following HD5 layout:

.. code-block:: text

    $ h5dump -n hamiltonian_ao_fcidump.h5
    HDF5 "hamiltonian_ao_fcidump.h5" {
    FILE_CONTENTS {
     group      /
     dataset    /core_energy
     dataset    /ms2
     dataset    /nelec
     group      /one_mo
     dataset    /one_mo/array
     group      /two_mo
     dataset    /two_mo/array
     }
    }

Note that the integrals in this example are actually stored in the AO basis (unlike the ``_mo`` suffix suggests). Read the section :ref:`user_hf_dft_preparing_posthf` if you want to compute (and store) integrals in the molecular-orbital (MO) basis.

Loading
-------

You can load integrals, stored in Horton's internal format, as follows:

.. literalinclude :: ../data/examples/hamiltonian/load_internal_ao.py
    :caption: data/examples/hamiltonian/load_internal_ao.py
    :lines: 2-


.. _hamiltonian_io_fcidump:

FCIDUMP format
==============

Dumping
-------

The FCIDUMP format is mainly useful when exchanging Hamiltonians with different codes. Compared to the internal format, there are some restrictions:

1. The one-body terms must all be added into a single operator.
2. The integrals can only be stored in a restricted (MO) basis set, i.e. so no different basis sets for the alpha and beta orbitals are possible.
3. The two-electron integrals must be stored in a ``DenseFourIndex`` object, so the Cholesky decomposition of the ERI is not supported.

The FCIDUMP format is normally only used for storing integrals in the MO basis but the example here will use the AO basis. Read the section :ref:`user_hf_dft_preparing_posthf` if you want to compute (and store) integrals in the molecular-orbital (MO) basis. The usage is as follows:

.. literalinclude :: ../data/examples/hamiltonian/dump_fcidump_ao.py
    :caption: data/examples/hamiltonian/dump_fcidump_ao.py
    :lines: 2-

This example shows how the ``IOData`` attributes can be set by giving keyword arguments to the constructor. The file ``hamiltonian_ao.FCIDUMP`` will contain the following:

.. code-block:: text

     &FCI NORB=28,NELEC=20,MS2=0,
      ORBSYM= 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,
      ISYM=1
     &END
     5.9786161694613265e+00    1    1    1    1
    -1.0433683639500952e+00    2    1    1    1
     1.9823368119430076e-01    2    1    2    1
     6.1978840317716133e-01    2    2    1    1
    .
    .
    .
    -1.4611205008249136e+01   27   27    0    0
    -8.5804159203863803e-12   28   14    0    0
    -1.4611205008249140e+01   28   28    0    0
     2.0000000000000000e+01    0    0    0    0

The input file is divided into two blocks. The first block (between ``&FCI`` and ``&END``) contains system-specific information:

    :NORB: number of orbitals/basis functions
    :NELEC: number of electrons
    :MS2: spin projection
    :ORBSYM: irreducible representation of each orbital
    :ISYM: total symmetry of the wavefunction

The second block (after ``&END``) contains the one- and two-electron integrals as well as the core energy:

* First, all symmetry-unique elements of the two-electron integrals are listed, where the first column is the value of the integral, followed by the orbital indices. (Orbital indices start counting from one.) Note that the orbital indices (``i j k l``) in an FCIDUMP file are written in chemists' notation,

  .. math::

      (ij\vert kl) = \langle ik \vert jl \rangle = \int \phi_i^*(\mathbf{x}_1) \phi_k^*(\mathbf{x}_2) \frac{1}{r_{12}} \phi_j(\mathbf{x}_1) \phi_l(\mathbf{x}_2) d\mathbf{x}_1 d\mathbf{x}_2

* Second, all symmetry-unique elements of the one-electron integrals are listed, where again the first column is the value of the integral, followed by the orbital indices. Note that the last two columns contain zeros.

* Finally, the core energy (for instance, the nuclear repulsion term, etc.) is written on the last line with all orbital indices equal 0.

If the value of an integral is zero, the corresponding line is not included in the the FCIDUMP file.
