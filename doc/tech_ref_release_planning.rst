Release planning

Stable API and beta code
------------------------

In order to ensure that users and developers spend as little time as possible
performing maintenance work unrelated to research, the developers of HORTON have
committed to providing a stable Application Programmer Interface (API). This
means that most new releases of HORTON will remain compatible with your code and
will not change the behaviour of your code.

.. warning::

    *The stable API policy only applies to public members of code.* If you
    access private members of classes directly (i.e. _array in Matrix), you can
    expect breakage even between bugfix releases!

- Major releases (i.e. 1.x.x -> 2.x.x) will not guarantee compatiblity with past
  versions. 

  * We will wait a minimum of 18 months between major releases. 
  * These releases will contain overarching restructuring of the code and
    renaming of functions and classes, including removal of deprecated code.


- Minor releases (i.e. 1.1.x -> 1.2.x) will remain compatible with past
  versions. 

  * These releases will be used to introduce new features or tweaks to existing
    code. 
  * New algorithms for existing features will be disabled by default in order to
    preserve old behaviour.


- Bugfix releases (i.e. 1.1.1 -> 1.1.2) will not make any changes to the code
  except to fix bugs.


- Occasionally, we will release features marked as *beta* to speed up sharing
  ideas. 

  * They do not adhere to this stable API policy. We reserve the right to break
    API in beta features at any time.
