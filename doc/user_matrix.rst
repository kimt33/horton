How to use the matrix package?
##############################

Introduction
============

In HORTON, we use our own Matrix package (abstraction layer) to implement the
linear algebra code (low-level) into the quantum chemistry code (high-level). There
are two main reasons for such implementation:

1. We can develop new linear algebra operations without breaking the higher-level
   code. For example, if we implemented Cholesky decomposition for the transformation
   of 2-electron integrals, we should be able to use this method in the Geminals
   code without rewriting the Geminals code.
2. Numpy, the conventional linear algbebra package in Python, may not manage
   memory effectively for large structures, such as the 2-electron
   integrals. For example, Numpy allocates temporary memory when evaluating ``a += b``, which
   is costly when  ``a`` or ``b`` is very large. We developed a Matrix package
   (using the Numpy package) geared towards memory management of quantum
   chemistry calculations, and we use that package (Matrix package) instead of Numpy
   directly.

Although such an abstraction layer seems pedantic and ostentatious, and requires
a tedious implementation of all new operations into the Matrix package, the
small penalty in performance and the ease of implementing different concepts
into the low-level areas of HORTON make it well worth the effort.

Below conceptualizes the organization of HORTON:

How to use this abstraction layer
=================================

The Matrix package is organized (in ``horton/matrix``) as follows:

The package consists of `backend` modules, each with their own implementation of
the data storage and manipulation. So far, there are two such modules, a dense
Numpy storage and Cholesky decomposition of the Numpy storage. Because these
modules treat data in fundamentally different ways, each method used by the
higher-level module (listed in the ``base.py``) must be implemented.

Then, the code for each module is organized by the type of data that is
manipulated within a class. So far, classes for 1-index tensor, 2-index tensor,
3-index tensor, 4-index tensor, and wavefunction expansion have been
implemented.

To avoid reallocation of memory, we use a :class:`.LinalgFactory` instance to
create these objects (e.g. 2-index tensor). This instance will allocate memory
for these objects, and then, the operations performed on these objects will modify
their own attributes directly. Most of the operations are in-place, i.e.
modifying their own data based on input and not returning any output.

For example, to create and modify a dense two-index tensor, we first create a
LinalgFactory instance and call it ``lf``:

.. code-block:: python

    lf = DenseLinalgFactory()

We use ``lf`` to allocate a two index tensor object:

.. code-block:: python

    A = lf.create_two_index() #matrix

We can also pass ``lf`` as an argument to other parts of the code, which
uses it to allocate an object.

.. code-block:: python

    er = obasis.compute_electron_repulsion(lf)

We can modify the two-tensor object by some in-place operations:

.. code-block:: python

    #A = A + B
    A.iadd(B)

    #A = A * B
    A.idot(B)

    #A = B + C (NOT POSSIBLE)
    #A = A + B
    A.iadd(B)
    #A = A + C
    A.iadd(C)

Note that more complex operations, such as (`A = B + C`), can be broken up into
a series of in-place operations, that deal with explicitly allocated memory.

We can appreciate the simplicity of implementing different modules by playing
with the different `backend` modules available. For example, we could have used

.. code-block:: python

    lf = CholeskyLinalgFactory()

in place of the ``DenseLinalgFactory`` above. Making this change will not change
any of the preceeding code, provided that the same objects are implemented into
this module as well.

We can also allocate different objects, if implemented, using ``lf``:

.. code-block:: python

    A4 = lf.create_four_index() #4_rank_tensor
    wfn = lf.create_expansion() #wavefunction expansion

Many functions and classes have been implemented into the Matrix class. It may
help to read over some of the documented module files in
:py:mod:`horton.matrix.dense` and :py:mod:`horton.matrix.cholesky`
to see if a desired function has already been implemented.
