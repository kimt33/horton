Common problems
###############

Trouble building or installing HORTON
=====================================

Let's assume you have already built and installed all your dependencies correctly.
You try to install HORTON, i.e.

.. code-block:: bash

    ./setup.py install --user

or you run nosetests, but something goes wrong. Remember, you have installed all your dependencies
correctly, so the problems you are facing has to do with finding and using those
dependencies. Chances are, you have installed the dependencies using different
methods, e.g. yum, apt-get, macports, homebrew, pip, and compilation from source. You
may even have the same dependency installed multiple times using different methods.
You have to make sure your system can find the right dependency and be able to use
it. We've encountered problems with three types of dependencies: Python modules,
executables, and libraries.

Python modules
--------------

If you have installed some python module (i.e. numpy, scipy, cython, h5py, sympy,
matplotlib, nosetests, sphinx, doxygen, breathe, docutils) and you get an error
saying your system cannot find such module, then you need to set the environment
variable ``PYTHONPATH`` to include your module's location. For example, Mac users
that installed modules through PIP may need to include their user site-packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PYTHONPATH=/Users/username/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH

or their system site-packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PYTHONPATH=/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH

Similarly, Linux users that installed modules through PIP may need to include

.. code-block:: bash

    export PYTHONPATH=userbase/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages

or

.. code-block:: bash

    export PYTHONPATH=/lib/python2.7/site-packages

or

.. code-block:: bash

    export PYTHONPATH=/lib64/python2.7/site-packages

The idea is to find your module (the directory that contains the files to use that
module), and add its parent directory to the ``PYTHONPATH``. Finding the module
can be tricky, but remember, there are finite number of files on your hard drive.
You can use unix commands like ``find`` to speed up the process. You can look up
where your package manager installs packages. You can explicitly build your module
in a location that you will remember (try to adopt some convention for installing
modules). As shown above, the python modules are commonly installed in

.. code-block:: bash

   `userbase`/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages
   `root`/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages

for Mac users, and

.. code-block:: bash

   `userbase`/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
   `root`/lib/python2.7/site-packages

for Linux users, where `userbase` is the directory of the user, and `root` is the root
directory.


Excecutables
------------

Let's say for whatever reason, HORTON requires the use of an executable for
installation. Then, this executable must be in the same directory as the current
directory, i.e. root of your source tree, or in one of the directories in ``PATH``
environment variable. For example, Mac users that uses python scripts might do

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH=/Users/username/Library/Python/2.7/bin:$PATH

or

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH=/Library/Python/2.7/bin:$PATH

Similarly, Linux users may do

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH

or

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH=/bin:$PATH

Using linux function ``find`` may help you find the appropriate directory.

Libraries
---------

Let's assume you have built your library correctly. Then, you need to make sure
``setup.py`` can find your libraries and their executables. You should consult
:ref:`setup_cfg` for a more complete understanding of the library linking process
in HORTON installation. Here, we will show how we solved some problems we've faced
in finding and linking libraries.

First, we need to find the library. We can locate the libraries install by using
the unix command ``ldconfig``:

.. code-block:: bash

    ldconfig -p | grep libraryname

``ldconfig -p`` prints all cached libraries, and piping to ``grep`` searches through
the results for the library with the ``libraryname``. Perhaps ``find`` would give
a more thorough search, especially if your library has been cached yet. Here is
an example, where we tried to find atlas libraries in a cluster:

.. code-block:: bash

    ldconfig -p | grep atlas

which gives

.. code-block:: bash

	libptf77blas.so.3 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib64/atlas/libptf77blas.so.3
	libptf77blas.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib64/atlas/libptf77blas.so
	libptcblas.so.3 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib64/atlas/libptcblas.so.3
	libptcblas.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib64/atlas/libptcblas.so
	liblapack.so.3 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib64/atlas/liblapack.so.3
	liblapack.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib64/atlas/liblapack.so
	libf77blas.so.3 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib64/atlas/libf77blas.so.3
	libf77blas.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib64/atlas/libf77blas.so
	libclapack.so.3 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib64/atlas/libclapack.so.3
	libclapack.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib64/atlas/libclapack.so
	libcblas.so.3 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib64/atlas/libcblas.so.3
	libcblas.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib64/atlas/libcblas.so
	libatlas.so.3 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib64/atlas/libatlas.so.3
	libatlas.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib64/atlas/libatlas.so

We see that all the libraries are located in ``/usr/lib64/atlas/``. Notice that
all the libraries are in x86-64 instruction set.

Then, we need to find the include directory. You can find this using the ``find``
function. Usually, the include directory is almost same as the library directory,
except instead of the ``lib``, there is ``include``. Continuing the above example,

.. code-block:: bash

    ls -d /usr/include/*atlas*

will give the list of directories that includes the word ``atlas``. The output
gives:

.. code-block:: bash

   /usr/include/atlas
   /usr/include/atlas-x86_64-base

Since we used the x86-64 instruction set, we select the directory that would
correspond with that instruction set, i.e. ``/usr/include/atlas-x86_64-base``.

In the above list of libraries associated with atlas, we have ``ptf77blas``,
``ptcblas``, ``lapack``, ``f77blas``, ``clapack``, ``cblas``, and ``atlas``.
Though we can include all these libraries, HORTON only uses ``atlas``, ``cblas``,
``f77blas``, and ``lapack``. Therefore, the resulting ``setup.cfg`` file included

.. code-block:: bash

  [blas]
  library_dirs=/usr/lib64/atlas
  libraries=atlas:lapack:f77blas:cblas
  include_dirs=/usr/include/atlas-x86_64-base


Similarly, we can repeat the process for the LibXC and Libint2, where the libraries
that are needed are only ``libxc`` and ``libint``, respectively.
