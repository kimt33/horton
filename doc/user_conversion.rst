Conversion between file formats
###############################


``horton-convert.py`` -- Conversion between file formats supported by Horton
============================================================================

The script ``horton-convert.py`` is experimental. It can be used to convert
between different file formats supported by Horton. Run ``horton-convert.py
--help`` for more details.


.. _hdf2csv:

``horton-hdf2csv.py`` -- Conversion of HDF5 files to CSV format
===============================================================

The script ``horton-hdf2csv.py`` is used as follows::

    horton-hdf2csv.py somefile.h5:path/in/hdf5/file otherfile.csv

For example, if ``horton-wpart.py`` was used to run an Extended Hirshfeld
partitioning of a wavefunction in ``gaussian.fchk``, then the following would
convert the results into CSV format::

    horton-hdf2csv.py wpart_he_results.h5 extended_hirshfeld.csv

This script was added for the convenience of those who do not know how to
process the HDF5 output generated by the Horton scripts. If you know how,
please process the HDF5 files directly with custom scripts. This would be far easier
than interfacing to the CSV files. The `h5py
<http://www.h5py.org/>`_ library is a great tool to make such custom
scripts.
