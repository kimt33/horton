'''Two-, three- and four-dimensional matrix implementations

   The purpose of this package is to provide a generic API for different
   implementations of real-valued double precision matrix storage and
   operations.

   Two-dimensional matrices are supposed to be symmetric and are used to
   represent two-index operators and 1DRDMs. Four-dimensional matrices are used
   to represent four-index operators, which are invariant under the following
   interchanges of indexes::

            <ij|kl> = <ji|lk> = <kl|ij> = <lk|ji> =
            <il|kj> = <jk|li> = <kj|il> = <li|jk>

   This module assumes physicists notation for the two-particle operators. It is
   up to the specific implementations of the matrices to make use of these
   symmetries.

   One should use these matrix implementations without accessing the internals
   of each class, i.e. without accessing attributes or methods that start with
   an underscore.

   In order to avoid temporaries when working with arrays, the methods do
   not return arrays. Instead such methods are an in place operation or have
   output arguments. This forces the user to allocate all memory in advance,
   which can then be moved out of the loops. The initial implementation (the
   Dense... classes) are just a proof of concept and may therefore contain
   internals that still make temporaries. This fixed later with an alternative
   implementation.
