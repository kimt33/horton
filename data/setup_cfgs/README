The setup files in this directory follow a fixed naming scheme such that they
can be picked up by the setup.py script when it fails to find proper compiler
or linker settings in any other way.

For Linux distributions, the format is

    setup.Linux-Distriburion-Version-Arch.cfg

For Mac OS/X, the format is

    setup.Darwin-Version-Arch.cfg

Check the screen output for the proper machine string for your environment.
There will be a line starting with "MACHINE=" giving you the machine string.
This means it will check for setup.${MACHINE}.cfg in this directory for compiler
flags.

The purpose of these *.cfg file is to fill in the right settings for a default
configuration on the machine.

Read the section "Controlling dynamic/static linking against LibXC, LibInt2
and BLAS" in the HORTON documentation for more details.
